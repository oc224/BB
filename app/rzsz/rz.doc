       This program uses error correcting protocols to receive	files  over  a
       dial-in	serial	port  from a variety of programs running under PC-DOS,
       CP/M, Unix, and other operating systems.	 It is invoked	from  a	 shell
       prompt  manually, or automatically as a result of an "sz file ..." com-
       mand given to the calling program.

       To obtain the maximum performance and full functionality of  this  pro-
       gram we recommend its use with GSZ, Professional-YAM or ZCOMM.

       This  program is intended to act as a server for terminal programs, not
       to act as one.  This program is not designed to be called  from	_c_u_(_1_)_,
       _t_i_p_(_1_)_,	or  other  communications programs.  The client rz/sz package,
       distributed in (crzsz.zip), is designed to be  called  from  such  pro-
       grams.

       Unix flavors of Omen Technology's Professional-YAM communications soft-
       ware are suitable for  dial-out	applications.	Unix  Professional-YAM
       supports	 dial-out  applications	 with  telephone directory, a powerful
       script language with learn function,  high  quality  multiple  protocol
       support, and UUCP port arbitration.


       RRzz  (Receive  ZMODEM) receives one or more files with the ZMODEM proto-
       col.  Pathnames are supplied by the sending  program,  and  directories
       are created if necessary.  (See the example below.)  If standard output
       is not redirected to a file or pipe, output is appended to a file named
       "stdout".

       Normally,  the "rz" command is automatically issued by the calling ZMO-
       DEM program, but defective ZMODEM implementations may require  starting
       _r_z manually.

       RRbb  receives  file(s)  with  YMODEM, accepting either standard 128 byte
       sectors or 1024 byte sectors (Pro-YAM/ZCOMM sb --kk  option).   The  user
       should  determine  when	the  1024  byte block length actually improves
       throughput.

       If True YMODEM  (Omen  Technology  trademark)  file  information	 (file
       length,	etc.)	is  received,  the  file length controls the number of
       bytes written to the output dataset and the modify time (iff non	 zero)
       are set accordingly.

       If  True	 YMODEM file information is not received, slashes in the path-
       name are changed to underscore, and any trailing period in the pathname
       is  eliminated.	This conversion is useful for files received from CP/M
       and other historical systems.

       RRcc receives a single _f_i_l_e with XMODEM-CRC  or  XMODEM-1k-CRC  protocol.
       The  user  should  determine  when  the 1024 byte block length actually
       improves throughput without causing problems.  The user must supply the
       file  name  to both sending and receiving programs.  Up to 1023 garbage
       characters may be added to the received file.

       RRxx receives a single _f_i_l_e with XMODEM or XMODEM-1k protocol.  The  user
       should  determine  when	the  1024  byte block length actually improves
       throughput without causing problems.  The user  must  supply  the  file
       name  to both sending and receiving programs.  Up to 1023 garbage char-
       acters may be added to the received file.

       GGzz is a shell script which calls _s_z to  command	Pro-YAM	 or  ZCOMM  to
       transmit	 the  specified files.	Pathnames used with _g_z must be escaped
       if they have special significance to the Unix shell.
       EXAMPLE: gz "-a C:*.c D:*.h"

       If invoked with a leading ''v'', _r_z will report progress to /tmp/rzlog.
       EXAMPLE: ln rz vrz; rz=vrz; export rz

       If  the	RESTRICTED  shell  environment variable is set to 1, or if the
       SHELL environment variable includes _r_s_h	or  _r_k_s_h  (restricted  shell),
       registered copies of _r_z will not accept command uploads, absolute path-
       names, references to a parent directory, will not  modify  an  existing
       file, and removes any files received in error.
       EXAMPLE: RESTRICTED=1 rz


       The meanings of the available options are:

       cc      Use CRC-16 for XMODEM transfers.
       ttTTIIMMEEOOUUTT
	      Change TIMEOUT to _T_I_M_E_O_U_T tenths of seconds.
       qq      Quiet  suppresses	 the routine message display.  (New in Version
	      5)
       vv      Verbose causes a list of file names to be appended to /tmp/rzlog
	      .	 More v's generate more detailed debugging output.
       wwWWIINNDDOOWW
	      Use  a  receive  window of WINDOW bytes.	Details in the Profes-

(Pro-YAM command)
_<_A_L_T_-_2_>
Pro-YAM Command: _s_z _*_._h _*_._c
This automatically invokes _r_z on the connected system, and sends all .h and .c
files in the current directory.

_s_z _-_n _-_R_f _.
This  Professional-YAM	command recursively follows the current directory tree
(.) (Pro-YAM -R option), sends the full relative pathname (-f), for files that
are newer (-n) than their copies on the destination system.

_r_z _| _s_o_r_t _>_/_t_m_p_/_s_o_r_t_e_d
_s_z _O_N_A_M_E_=_- _*_._l_s_t
The  first  command  manually starts rrzz with output piped to the sort command.
The second command instructs Professional-YAM, ZCOMM, GSZ or DSZ to  sene  the
files using "-" as pathname, which instructs rrzz to output the received data to
its standard output.  The end result is a single file containing all the lines
of the .lst files sorted alphabetically.

       Exit status is as follows: 0 for successful transfers.  1 if unrecover-
       able errors are detected.  2 if syntax errors or file  access  problems
       are detected.  3 if the program was terminated by a caught interrupt.

SSEERRVVEERR//NNEETTWWOORRKK NNOOTTEESS
       Terminals  on  some timesharing systems are connected indirectly to the
       host with TTEERRMMIINNAALL SSEERRVVEERRSS operating over networks.   Terminal  servers
       often  interfere	 with  file  transfers	by "eating" control characters
       and/or losing data.

       Accessing a distant system using tteellnneett on a local Unix system  entails
       the  same  problems.  If tteellnneett does not work well, try rrllooggiinn with the
       --88 option.  Set the escape character to ^P (control P)  which  is  pro-
       tected by ZMODEM.

       When  terminal  servers	interfere with file transfers, server commands
       are often available to help the problem.	  When	possible,  enable  the
       server and modems for hardware flow control in and out.	Set the termi-
       nal server to telnet transparent mode.  Some typical commands are  "SET
       TERMINAL	 DOWNLOAD",  "set session passall", and "SET TERMINAL NO ESC",
       but there is no standard set of	commands  suitable  for	 all  terminal
       servers.	  Normally  these  commands  are  given before attempting file
       transfers, but one user has reported that the  command  must  be	 given
       _a_f_t_e_r  the  file transfer is started(!).	 Until terminal server vendors
       improve the quality of their product, you may have to get on their case
       until they adequately support high performance file transfers.

       The telnet protcol used by the _t_e_l_n_e_t program and terminal servers uses
       0xFF (377 octal) for special control functions.	The 0xFF character may
       cause  problems	if it appears in the data stream, especially uploading
       at high speeds.	With ZCOMM or Professional-YAM the 0xFF character  can
       be protected by giving the command:
       set zmtxesc ?

       Escaping	 control characters with ZMODEM (sz -e) may help if the trans-
       fer gets stuck in the same place on  every  attempt.   Professional-YAM
       and  ZCOMM  allow  selection  of	 which	control	 characters need to be
       escaped.	 In extreme cases 7-bit transmission may be required (see  the
       Professional-YAM/ZCOMM manual).	If you encounter problems with control
       characters you should identify which control characters are causing the
       problem.	 Please refer to the sz -T command in sz.doc for more help.

       Flow  control  between  the  server and modem is often defective.  This
       rarely causes a problem in interactive applications whose short	bursts
       (a  screenfull  at  most)  fit  within  the  available  memory buffers.
       Streaming protocols such as YMODEM-g, long packet SuperKermit, and ZMO-
       DEM  can	 overload the available buffering.  Some terminal servers sup-
       port commands to enable hardware flow control such as "TERM FLOWCONTROL
       HARDWARE	 IN  OUT";  this  assumes  the modem attached to the server is
       properly configured.

       If the terminal server is too brain damaged to  support	flow  control,
       ZMODEM lets you fake it by setting a window size.  Try
	    sz -w2048 file...
       to  enable  software  flow  control.   Experiment with different window
       sizes for best results.

       Terminal servers are designed to accept keyboard input from human oper-
       ators.	They  may lose data when a program sends more data to the host
       faster than humans type.	 Some servers allow larger  input  buffers  to
       support	file  uploads.	 If  you can upload short files (less than 100
       bytes) but not longer files, try
	    sz -w1024 file...
       with your uploading program.  (Not all programs	support	 this  option;
       use ZCOMM or Professional-YAM.)

       When both flow control and character transparency are problems, use
	    sz -ew1024 file...
       as a starting point.

       Sometimes  the  terminal	 server software is defective and must be cor-
       rected.	Please contact the network's vendor for corrective procedures.
       An  alternative is to install direct serial ports for users desiring to
       upload files.

       We have also encountered problems when  networking  software  fails  to
       pass data after a large amount of data has been sent to the host.  This
       has happened on a PPP internet connection which	prevented  uploads  of
       large  amounts  of data via either FTP or a ZMODEM upload (via TELNET).
       The PPP connection grinds to a standstill and not even PING works.  The
       same  ZMODEM/TELNET  combination easily uploaded ten times as much to a
       nearby machine connected by Ethernet.


PPOORRTT WWAATTCCHHEERRSS
       Some systems enforce a timeout which disconnects a user	after  several
       minutes	of  keyboard inactivity.  Long, error free ZMODEM transfers do
       not generate keyboard activity (this is why ZMODEM  is  so  efficient).
       Restricting the window size with
	    sz -w16384 file...
       option generates terminal input at regular intervals even when no error
       correction is needed.   If  problems  persist,  try  setting  a	packet
       length.
	    sz -l1024 file...
       (The default ZMODEM packet length is the file length.)

NNOOTTEESS
       RRzz,,  rrbb,,	 and  rrxx are hard links to the rz executable.  These links are
       automatically made by the Makefile.

       ZMODEM's support of XOFF/XON flow control allows	 proper	 operation  in
       many  environments  that do not support XMODEM uploads.	Unfortunately,
       not all Unix versions  support  input  flow  control.   The  TTY	 input
       buffering  on  some  systems  may  not adequately buffer long blocks or
       streaming input at high speed.  You should suspect  this	 problem  when
       you  can't  send	 data  to the Unix system at high speeds using ZMODEM,
       YMODEM-1k or XMODEM-1k, but YMODEM with 128 byte blocks works properly.

       The  DSZ	 or  Pro-YAM  zzmmooddeemm ll numeric parameter may be set to a value
       between 64 and  1024  to	 limit	the  burst  length  ("zmodem  pl128").
       Although this compromises ZMODEM's throughput, ZMODEM's superior relia-
       bility remains intact.

       If a program that does not properly implement the specified file trans-
       fer  protocol  causes  _r_z  to  "hang" the port after a failed transfer,
       either wait for _r_z to time out or keyboard a dozen  Ctrl-X  characters.
       Every  reported	instance  of  this problem has been corrected by using
       ZCOMM, Pro-YAM, DSZ, or other program with a correct implementation  of
       the specified protocol.

       Many  programs  claiming	 to support YMODEM only support XMODEM with 1k
       blocks, and they often don't get that quite right.

       In the case of a few poorly  designed  microcomputers,  sending	serial
       data  to	 a  tty	 port at sustained high speeds has been known to cause
       lockups,	 system	 halts,	 kernel	 panics,  and  occasional   antisocial
       behaviour.  This problem is not unique to _r_z_; newer versions of Kermit,
       CRT terminals with screen transmission, and line noise  have  the  same
       effect.	When experimenting with high speed input to a system, consider
       rebooting the system if the file transfers are  not  successful,	 espe-
       cially if the personality of the system appears altered.

       The  Unix  "ulimit"  parameter  must be set high enough to permit large
       file transfers to Unix.

       Telebit modems must not be set to "spoof" UUCP, XMODEM, YMODEM, or KER-
       MIT.   Setting one of these spoofing modes interferes with other proto-
       cols.  Telebit's YMODEM spoofing interferes with YMODEM transfers.

       Escaping	 all  control characters (sz -e) may help if the transfer gets
       stuck in the same place on every attempt.  Professional-YAM  and	 ZCOMM
       allow selection of which control characters need to be escaped.

       In  extreme cases 7-bit transmission may be required (see Professional-
       YAM/ZCOMM manual).  7-bit transmission  requires	 rz  version  4.50  or
       higher.

       Please refer to the sz -T command in sz.doc for more help.

       This version of _r_z does not support some ZMODEM features.  Unix flavors
       of Professional-YAM may be linked to "rz" to support these features.

       The ASCII  option´s  CR/LF  to  NL  translation	merely	deletes	 CR´s;
       undos(omen) performs a more intelligent translation.
